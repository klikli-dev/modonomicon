# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to follow the step by step guide **[Step by Step with Datagen](./step-by-step-with-datagen/)**. This guide uses datagen - a forge feature - which means as part of the process you will learn how to set up a simple mod development environment. 

:::tip

Even for modpack creators it is recommended to follow this process. Datagen is a much more convenient way to create books and ensure they do not have errors that might keep them from loading or from working in game.

## Manually creating books 

If you instead want to manually create a book by editign JSON files directly there is currently no step-by-step guide, however you can look at the generated results of the above guide **[here](https://github.com/klikli-dev/modonomicon-demo-book/tree/main/src/generated/resources)**.

Further, you can reference the [Structure](../basics/structure/) section to learn about the file structures.
