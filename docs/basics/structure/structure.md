# Book Structure

Each Modonomicon Book consists of Categories, Entries and Pages. Entries are grouped into Categories, which are grouped into the Book itself. Pages are part of the Entries and represent the actual content of the book, they can be used to display text, images, recipes and more.

The file structure looks as follows:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="hierarchy" label="Hierarchy" default>

- `data/<mod_id>/modonomicon/books/<book_id>/`
  - `book.json`
  - `categories/`
    - `<category_id1>.json`
    - `<category_id2>.json`
    - ...
  - `entries/`
    - `<category_id1>`
      - `<entry_id1>.json`
      - `<entry_id2>.json`
      - ...
    - `<category_id2>`
      - `<entry_id3>.json`
      - `<entry_id4>.json`
      - ...

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="screenshot" label="Example Screenshot">

A book with the book id `demo` and the mod id `modonomicon` would look like this:
